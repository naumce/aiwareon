# � Tonight's Look

**Get Event-Ready in 3 Taps**

## The Idea

A simple, themed entry point in AIWear that helps users put together their perfect look for tonight's event.

**Name Options:**
- "Tonight's Look"
- "Event Ready"  
- "Red Carpet Mode"
- "Dress My Night"

## How It Works (Using Existing Features)

### Step 1: What's the Occasion?
User taps an occasion button:

| 🎬 Premiere | 💃 Date Night | 🎉 Party | 👔 Formal | ✨ Special |

### Step 2: Pick Your Base (Person Photo)
- Use saved photo from "My Photos"
- Or take a new one

### Step 3: Try Looks
- Swipe through wardrobe items
- Each tap = instant AI try-on
- Heart ❤️ the ones you love

### Step 4: Your Look is Ready
- Save to gallery
- Share or keep private

## UI Changes Needed

1. **New button on Studio page:** "Tonight's Look" (or similar)
2. **Occasion picker:** Simple emoji + label buttons
3. **Quick swipe mode:** Faster browsing of wardrobe items
4. **Heart/save favorites:** Mark the looks you love

## No New Backend

Uses existing:
- Wardrobe items
- AI try-on (Fal/Gemini)
- Generation gallery
- User photos

---

## The Vibe

Think of it like Tinder for outfits:
- Swipe through options
- Heart what you love
- Build your perfect look

Fast, fun, focused.
