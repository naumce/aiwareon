# Product Scope

AIWear is an AI-powered clothing try-on application.

Core capabilities:
- Upload or capture a person image
- Upload or select a clothing image
- Generate a realistic try-on result
- Preview results
- Save results for logged-in users

Out of scope:
- Video generation
- Social feeds
- Messaging
- Community features
- Complex prompt editing

Rule:
If a feature does not directly support clothing try-on,
it does not belong in the MVP.
