# AIWear System Patterns

This folder defines the authoritative patterns for the AIWear project.

These patterns are NON-NEGOTIABLE.

Rules:
- Code must follow these patterns
- No new patterns may be invented
- If a requirement is unclear or missing, STOP and ask
- Simplicity and clarity are preferred over cleverness

Patterns define HOW the system works.
Implementation may vary, patterns must not.
